# nri-image-policy uninstaller — run as a privileged pre-delete hook.

# Reverses install.sh on a single node: removes our NRI containerd
# registration (drop-in file on rke2, sentinel-delimited block in
# config.toml on k8s), restarts containerd so the plugin process exits, and
# deletes the host artifacts (binary, configs, cache). Idempotent — safe to
# re-run after a partial uninstall.

#   HOST_CONFIG_PATH       — host path of the runtime config

#                            /host<dir>
#   CONTAINERD_CONFIG_MODE — "patch" or "dropin", matching install.sh
