# ratls-mesh

Transparent L4 TCP proxy that wraps pod-to-pod Kubernetes traffic in RA-TLS (Remote Attestation TLS). Each node runs one DaemonSet pod that intercepts TCP flows whose source and destination are known pod IPs, establishes hardware-attested mTLS to the destination node, and delivers traffic to local pods on the inbound side. Applications require zero modification.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture, trust model, and design decisions.

## Build

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ratls-mesh ./cmd/ratls-mesh
```

## Usage

### Proxy mode (default)

```bash
ratls-mesh \
  --platform sev-snp \
  --attestation-api-url http://localhost:8400 \
  --outbound-port 15001 \
  --inbound-port 15006 \
  --health-port 15021
```

Node IP is auto-detected from the `NODE_IP` environment variable (Kubernetes downward API) or set via `--node-ip`.

### Subcommands

```bash
# Watch Kubernetes pods and keep iptables/ipset routing current
ratls-mesh iptables-sync --outbound-port 15001 --uid 1337

# Remove iptables NAT rules and ipsets (runs as preStop hook)
ratls-mesh iptables-cleanup
```

## Routing Model

In the Helm chart, "known pod IP" means a non-hostNetwork Pod IP observed from
the Kubernetes API. `iptables-sync` maintains separate IPv4/IPv6 ipsets for all
known pods and for pods scheduled on the current node.

| Flow | Intercepted? | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Same-node pod TCP to a known pod IP | Yes | Host `PREROUTING` matches source in the local-pod ipset (pods scheduled on this node) and destination in the all-pod ipset. |
| Host process TCP to a known pod IP | Yes, unless its UID is excluded | Host `OUTPUT` matches destination in the all-pod ipset and skips the mesh UID plus `--exclude-uids`. |
| Mesh proxy TCP to a destination node inbound port | No | The destination is a node IP, not a pod IP, and the mesh UID is excluded from `OUTPUT`. |
| ClusterIP Services, kube API, metadata, and public egress | No | The destination is not a pod IP when the mesh chains run, so these flows fall through without static pod CIDRs. |
| External or ingress TCP directly to a pod IP | No | The source is not in the local-pod ipset. |

The outbound listener also validates the original destination before proxying:
direct connections to the host-network listener are rejected unless the original
destination is a known pod IP. The inbound listener only forwards to local
non-hostNetwork pod IPs.

### Confidential-workload inbound guard

The flows the mesh does not intercept would otherwise reach pods in
plaintext, including confidential workloads: a ClusterIP Service selecting
cw pods hands kube-proxy a VIP the mesh never matches, and sources in
`--exclude-source-namespaces` dial pod IPs directly. With
`--enforce-cw-inbound` (chart: `ratlsMesh.cwInboundEnforcement.enabled`,
default on), `iptables-sync` maintains an extra ipset of pod IPs labeled
`confidential.ai/cw` and a filter-table chain (`RATLS-MESH-CW`, jumped from
`FORWARD` position 1) that drops any connection to those IPs, all protocols
(the mesh carries only TCP, so non-TCP inbound is unmeshed by definition).
Replies to cw-pod egress pass via a conntrack `ESTABLISHED,RELATED` rule.

Every legitimate delivery path avoids `FORWARD` and is unaffected: mesh
delivery is a host-originated `OUTPUT` dial from the proxy UID, kubelet
probes and host daemons are `OUTPUT`, and meshed pod-to-pod egress is
DNAT'd to the node's outbound listener (`INPUT`) in `PREROUTING` before
`FORWARD`. Dropped packets are counted in
`ratls_mesh_iptables_cw_inbound_drops_total`.

The guard has two structural preconditions: kube-proxy must be in
iptables mode (so a Service VIP is DNAT'd to the cw pod IP *before*
`FORWARD`), and the packet must traverse the host `FORWARD` hook. Under
kube-proxy **IPVS** (or **nftables**) mode the director rewrites VIP
traffic in `LOCAL_IN`/`LOCAL_OUT` without a nat-table DNAT, so a same-node
VIP-to-cw-pod flow skips `FORWARD` and is not dropped. Verify with the e2e
check on any cluster not running iptables-mode kube-proxy.

What this defends: in-cluster plaintext bypass of confidential-workload
pods — Services selecting cw pods, direct pod-IP dials from excluded or
non-meshed sources, hostNetwork agents on other nodes. What it does not
defend: the hypervisor or cloud provider (the CVM boundary's job), host
root on the node itself (inside the node trust boundary; it delivers via
`OUTPUT`), kube-proxy IPVS/nftables mode and CNIs whose datapath bypasses
the host `FORWARD` hook (verified on iptables-mode kube-proxy with Azure
CNI and kubenet at `bridge-nf-call-iptables=1`; run the e2e check on
anything else), and L7 attacks through the legitimate mesh path.

Inbound delivery is still protected by RA-TLS on the node-to-node leg. The
only plaintext segment is the final host-to-local-pod dial on the destination
node. When the host exposes local pod-network CIDRs, `ValidateLocalDest`
cross-checks the destination Pod IP against those CIDRs and the kernel route.
On CNIs that do not expose a local pod CIDR on the host, such as AKS with
Azure CNI, the resolver falls back to the Kubernetes pod cache and only accepts
destinations whose `Pod.Status.HostIP` matches this node's `NODE_IP`.

### iptables sync flags

See "Routing Model" above for what `iptables-sync` watches and which flows
it intercepts. The flags below tune that loop.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--outbound-port` | `15001` | Outbound listener port used as the REDIRECT target |

| `--iptables-metrics-file` | `/tmp/ratls-iptables-metrics.json` | Shared file where `iptables-sync` publishes iptables/ipset counters for the proxy `/metrics` endpoint |
| `--log-level` | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

## Certificate Modes

The `--cert-mode` flag controls how ratls-mesh obtains TLS certificates:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `self-signed` | Default. RA-TLS self-signed certificates with attestation evidence embedded as X.509 extensions. Peers verify via hardware attestation chain. |
| `cds` | Boots with self-signed RA-TLS, then a background goroutine contacts CDS with exponential backoff (2s → 60s), obtains CA-signed certificates, and hot-swaps them. Once upgraded, stays on CA-signed certs. |

### Bootstrap flow (cds mode)

1. Proxy starts immediately with self-signed RA-TLS certificates (no CDS dependency at startup)
2. Background goroutine contacts CDS (one service): authenticate → attest → obtain leaf cert and authenticated CA bundle; CDS signs the CSR in-process
3. On success, `CertManager.SwapProvider()` hot-swaps to CA-signed certificates
4. `/ca` polling starts only after that authenticated CA bundle has seeded trust, and accepts only continuity-signed updates
5. Peer verification accepts BOTH RA-TLS attestation AND CA-chain during the transition (dual verification)
6. Once all nodes upgrade, CA-chain verification is the fast path

This design ensures zero-downtime upgrades — nodes can be upgraded from self-signed to CDS-issued certificates without service interruption.

**CA bundle wiring.** cds mode needs a CA trust root from CDS. The proxy
derives the CA bundle endpoint from `--cds-url` (the unified CDS serves
`/ca` on the same URL) and polls it every `--ca-poll-interval`.

### Dual verification

When `--ca-cert` is provided, the mesh accepts peers verified via either:
- A valid CA-signed certificate chain (fast path, standard X.509)
- A valid RA-TLS attestation extension (fallback, hardware verification)

This enables rolling upgrades where some nodes have CDS-issued certificates and others still use self-signed RA-TLS.

## Deployment

The supported chart path is `internal/helmchart/c8s/charts/ratls-mesh`, included
by the top-level `internal/helmchart/c8s` chart. The chart renders the proxy as
a DaemonSet and uses Kubernetes 1.29+ native sidecar init containers for iptables
synchronization and cleanup.

**Kubernetes version requirement.** The chart's `Chart.yaml` declares
`kubeVersion: ">=1.29.0-0"`. `iptables-cleanup` runs as a native sidecar
(`restartPolicy: Always` on an `initContainer`) so its `preStop` hook fires
last during shutdown and reliably tears down the managed chains/ipsets.
Kubernetes 1.28 exposed this behind the `SidecarContainers` feature gate, but
1.29 is the first release where the gate is enabled by default. Helm blocks the
install on older clusters via the `kubeVersion` constraint; do not bypass it.

The chart always renders `hostNetwork: true` and `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`; `iptables-sync` must run in the host network namespace to manage node-level pod traffic, so the value is not exposed.

Reviewer-relevant defaults:

| Value | Default | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `ports.inbound` | `15006` | Exposed as `hostPort` so peer nodes can establish RA-TLS sessions. |
| `ports.outbound` | `15001` | Container listener and REDIRECT target only; not exposed as `hostPort`. |
| `iptablesSync.resyncPeriod` | `30s` | Periodic reconciliation of pod ipsets and iptables rules. |
| `iptablesSync.ipsetMaxElem` | `262144` | Maximum size for each managed ipset. |
| `excludeUids` | `"0"` | Excludes root-owned host daemon traffic from `OUTPUT` redirect in addition to the mesh UID. |
| `ratls-mesh.measurements` | `[]` | SHA-384 hex launch digests that CDS's RA-TLS peer cert must match; empty accepts any (UNSAFE outside dev). |

## Observability

### Health probes

```
GET :15021/live    → 200 (always)
GET :15021/ready   → 200 (ready) / 503 (not ready or shutting down)
GET :15021/metrics → Prometheus text format
```

### Metrics

All metrics are prefixed with `ratls_mesh_`. Key metrics:

- `ratls_mesh_active_connections{direction}` — current open connections
- `ratls_mesh_connections_total{direction,result}` — total connections
- `ratls_mesh_bytes_total{direction,side}` — bytes transferred
- `ratls_mesh_tls_dial_failures_total` — RA-TLS failures
- `ratls_mesh_route_errors_total` — routing failures
- `ratls_mesh_cert_mode{mode}` — active certificate mode (label-keyed; the configured-mode value is 1)
- Go runtime metrics (`go_goroutines`, `go_memstats_*`) and process metrics are exposed via the standard prometheus client collectors

Routing-path counters and gauges worth alerting on are documented in
"Recommended alerts" below.

### Recommended alerts

The signals below govern the security-relevant routing path. The thresholds
are starting points; tune to your scrape interval and pod churn.

| Signal | What it means | Suggested rule |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `ratls_mesh_resolver_local_cidrs == 0` | `ValidateLocalDest` has no host pod-network CIDRs for the route cross-check, so inbound pod delivery is using Kubernetes `Pod.Status.HostIP` ownership. Expected briefly at startup and expected persistently on CNIs that expose pod IPs without a host-local pod CIDR, such as AKS with Azure CNI. | Warn after 2× `--resync-period` (default 60s) when this is unexpected for the cluster CNI. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_iptables_ipset_overflow_total[5m]) > 0` | Pod count exceeded `--ipset-maxelem`; the reconcile rejected the restore and the live ipset is stale. New pod IPs will not be intercepted until the operator bumps `iptablesSync.ipsetMaxElem`. | Page on any non-zero rate for 5+ minutes. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_iptables_jump_position_violations_total[5m])` | Watchdog confirmed our PREROUTING/OUTPUT jump was demoted out of position 1 — typically kube-proxy reinserting `KUBE-SERVICES` ahead of us. Occasional events are normal; a steady positive rate indicates a fight with kube-proxy. | Warn when rate > 1/min sustained for 10 min; tune `--watchdog-period` (default 2s) downward if necessary. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_iptables_jump_position_check_errors_total[5m])` | `iptables -S` failed during a watchdog tick. Watchdog reinserts defensively, so this is environmental noise, not a kube-proxy race. | Warn at a sustained rate to flag a stuck or busy `xtables.lock`. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_outbound_dest_rejected_total{reason="host_addr"}[5m])` | The host-network listener was reached with the node IP or loopback as the original destination — only possible by dialing `:15001` outside the iptables REDIRECT path. This is the security signal; there is no legitimate cause. | Warn on any sustained rate. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_iptables_cw_inbound_drops_total[5m]) > 0` | The cw inbound guard dropped packets: something dialed a confidential-workload pod outside the mesh — a Service VIP selecting cw pods, an excluded-namespace source, or a direct cross-node pod-IP dial. The workload is protected; the signal identifies a misconfigured or hostile client. | Warn on a sustained rate; investigate the source. |
| `rate(ratls_mesh_outbound_dest_rejected_total{reason="unknown_pod"}[5m])` | The outbound listener saw a destination that is not in the resolver's podMap — usually informer skew during pod churn, or a kube-proxy DNAT race after jump demotion. A small steady rate is normal. | Warn only on sustained spikes correlated with pod churn or `iptables_jump_position_violations_total`. |
| `time() - ratls_mesh_iptables_metrics_file_updated_at_seconds` | Seconds since the proxy last read a fresh snapshot from the iptables-sync sidecar. The sidecar's own watchdog/violation counters cannot signal a wedge after they stop being published; this gauge does. Gauge stays at 0 until the first successful read so cold-start alerts can filter on `> 0`. | Warn when `gauge > 0 and time() - gauge > 3 * <resync-period>` (default `> 90s`). |

### Logs

JSON structured logs to stdout. Each connection gets a unique `conn` ID:

```json
{"level":"INFO","msg":"connection done","conn":42,"dir":"outbound-ratls","dst":"10.244.1.5:8080","node":"10.0.0.2:15006","fwd":1024,"rev":512,"dur":"150ms"}
```

## Testing

```bash
# Focused unit and chart tests for this routing path
go test ./internal/cmds/ratlsmesh ./internal/helmchart ./cmd/c8s

# Compile Linux-only ratls-mesh tests that exercise iptables/ipset code
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go test -c -o /tmp/ratlsmesh-linux.test ./internal/cmds/ratlsmesh
```

Tests use fake SNP attestation reports, so no AMD hardware is required. Coverage
includes proxy data flow, RA-TLS handshakes, connection limits and drain,
resolver validation, health endpoints, metrics, iptables/ipset rule generation,
and Helm rendering for `hostNetwork`, `iptables-sync`, and hostPort behavior.
